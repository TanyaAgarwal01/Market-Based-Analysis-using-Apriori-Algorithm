# Market-Based-Analysis-using-Apriori-Algorithm
It is a project about Market Basket Analysis and the Apriori Algorithm that works behind it.
Association Rule Mining is used when you want to find an association between different objects in a set, find frequent patterns in a transaction database, relational databases 
or any other information repository.
The most common approach to find these patterns is Market Basket Analysis, which is a key technique used by large retailers like Amazon, Flipkart, etc to analyze customer buying
habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets”. The discovery of these associations can help retailers develop 
marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers. 


Apriori Algorithm
Apriori algorithm assumes that any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent. Its the algorithm behind Market Basket Analysis.
Say, a transaction containing {Grapes, Apple, Mango} also contains {Grapes, Mango}. So, according to the principle of Apriori, if {Grapes, Apple, Mango} is frequent, 
then {Grapes, Mango} must also be frequent.
